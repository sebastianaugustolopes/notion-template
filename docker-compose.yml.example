# IMPORTANT: This is a frontend-only application
# This project does NOT include backend services
# The backend (API) is a separate Spring Boot application that must be run independently
#
# To run this frontend:
# 1. Install dependencies: npm install
# 2. Start dev server: npm start
# 3. Navigate to http://localhost:4200
#
# Backend Setup:
# - The backend is a separate repository/project
# - Update API_URL in .env.example to point to your backend service
# - Default: http://localhost:8080/api (for local backend development)
